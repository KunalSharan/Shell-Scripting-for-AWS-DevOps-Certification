# Shell-Scripting-for-AWS-DevOps-Certification
These are scripts I am practicing with so that I can take the exam for AWS Certified DevOps Professional certification

I have basic understanding of the Unix Command Line and Shell Scripting. I write shell scripts to automate processes at work. With over a year of studying and practicing in the AWS environment, I will be taking the DevOps Pro certification exam soon. This repository contains the scripts I am writing to practice for the exam.

Disclaimer- These scripts are from linuxacademy.com and acloud.guru, I have edited the original scripts to point towards the resources I have created in my personal AWS account.

Thanks,
Kunal
